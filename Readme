To run RadViz++, please follow the steps below:

1) Download RadViz++.rar and extract the files in the folder/directory X
2) We must open a local server in X. For instance, I used python to open a local server in the door 8000:
  "python -m http.server 8000"
3) Open a browser (I recommend using Chrome) and type: http://localhost:8000/
4) Select RadViz++ in the option menu
5) For changing the dataset, go to X/html/dummies/radviz.html and edit the variable: 
  var data = "http://localhost:8000/datasets/segmentation.csv"
Also, remember to put the file in X/datasets/

Please, any doubts or suggestions, please contact carvalho.pagliosa@gmail.com.
